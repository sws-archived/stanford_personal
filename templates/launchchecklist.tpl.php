<h2>Launch Checklist</h2>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Content:</strong> Have you renamed any starter pages that aren&rsquo;t relevant to your site? Has all placeholder text in starter pages been replaced?</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Blocks:</strong> Have you hidden any blocks that aren&rsquo;t relevant to your site? Do your homepage and footer blocks have the correct content in them?</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Images:</strong> Are all placeholder images relevant to your site or have they been replaced? Do all images have short descriptive alternate text?</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Links:</strong> Are all &ldquo;Read More&rdquo; links and links within content correct? Are all of your menu links correct?</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>URL Redirects:</strong> Inventory the URLs from your old site to build redirects, so that those old links will still work after launch. Here is an <a target="_blank" href="https://stanford.box.com/s/h85hy9rgqhfaks2no07m">Example Spreadsheet</a>.</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Vanity URL:</strong> Do you already have, or have you requested, a <a target="_blank" href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/vhost">Vanity URL</a>?</li>
	<li dir="ltr"><strong>Approval: </strong>Does your site need to be approved by anyone other than you?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Are you ready to launch your site?</h2>
<p>Once you have gone through the launch checklist above, you can request to launch your site. Launching your site means that it will be assigned a Vanity URL (such as http://mysite.stanford.edu) and it will be made available to search engines.</p>
